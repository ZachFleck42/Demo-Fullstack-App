# Demo-Fullstack-App
A simple full stack web application created during the late-stages of an interview process with a startup.

Was tasked with designing, implementing, and deploying a webapp to display user data from an API. Successfully imlements authentication and data security, data upload functionality, and local user setting storage.

Implemented with Svelte / SvelteKit and hosted with GCP Firebase. 

Only worked on it for a single weekend, so there are definitiely some missing features. But serves as a good demonstration / skeleton for future projects.
